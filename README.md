## Usage

```html
<vcf-enhanced-rich-text-editor>
  ...
</vcf-enhanced-rich-text-editor>
```


### Tabstops
Tabstops can be set in UI by clicking on horizontal rullen, on top of the editor. There are 3 tabstop types: left, right and middle. When you click on ruller left tabstop will appear, then if you click on left tabstop it will change to right tabstop, and if you click on right tabstop it will change to middle tabstop.
It is also possible to set tabstops programaticaly by using `tabStops` property of editor. For example:
```js
editor.tabStops = [{direction: 'left', position: 150}, {direction: 'middle', position: 350}, {direction: 'right', position: 500}];
```

After tabstops are set, you can use them in editor. when you are focused in editor, press `tab` button and cursore will move to next tabstop. If there are no more tabstops, then tab symbol will be inserted in to text. 


### Customizing toolbar
```js
<vcf-enhanced-rich-text-editor></vcf-enhanced-rich-text-editor>
<script>
  window.addEventListener('WebComponentsReady', function() {
    var rte = document.querySelector("vcf-enhanced-rich-text-editor");
    rte.toolbarButtons = {undo: false, redo: false, h1: false, h2: false, h3: false, image: false, link: false};
  });
</script>
```

## Installation

The Vaadin components are distributed as Bower and npm packages.
Please note that the version range is the same, as the API has not changed.
You should not mix Bower and npm versions in the same application, though.

Unlike the official Polymer Elements, the converted Polymer 3 compatible Vaadin components
are only published on npm, not pushed to GitHub repositories.

```sh
bower i vaadin/vcf-enhanced-rich-text-editor --save

### Bundling with webpack
